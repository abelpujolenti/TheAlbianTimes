In each city, 3 men and 3 women await for an opportunity to seduce the protagonists and bring turmoil to their relationships. The ones who succeed board the train to replace the betrayed partner, who is expelled from the program.\n    Together with its innovative formula, the presence of Albian model and influencer Markel Rey has set the show for success.",
