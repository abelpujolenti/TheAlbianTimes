The launch caused massive clouds of dust, and large chuncks of waste fell towards nearby areas. Moreover, a sound intensity reading of 110 decibels three miles from the launch site was recorded.\n    These 'side effects' have a considerable impact in the area's wildlife, including the death of hundreds of birds.",
