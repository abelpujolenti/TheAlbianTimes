Everything has gone according to the committee's plans, since the deal signifies the legitimacy of the art world within the country. Even if the budget is unknown, Madia anounced that the Ables would receive more budget than in previous years, so the attendants and espectators should expect an improvement to their experience.",

Instead of promoting meaningful cultural expressions, the Madian government seems to be encouraging the incursion of mass culture, as the films nominated for the Ables have the sole purpose of supplying the masses with ephemeral entertainment, in order to continue the cycle of consumption.",

The building, designed by renowned architect SÃ©bastien bin Benderang in a modern expressionist style, is set to become one of Madia's main landmarks. The neo-renaissance interior stands out thanks to its stunning golden accents and beautiful details.\n    The Ables have had issues for many years with the size of the stadium, and had been looking for another place to hold the event.\n    It was thanks to the agreement between the Ables and the Madian government that the Opera Stadium was renovated, in order to continue hosting the event.",
