            "text": "    Recently, Madia's government has been putting an stronger focus on trying education and has therefore setout a large sum of money into making their institutions better, and more accessible.\n    Price-wise the universities have been slashed to 50% of what they were previously. This includes the private institutions as they have decided this move would make them more popular in the long run.\n    There has also been an effort into making these areas even more walkable than they were previously, adding a new metro stop and tram line through the university areas.\n    The main issue is that the art universities were considered for these upgrades, but deemed unnecessary as they had recently already had renovations and easier access to grants for students. There are now protests among students and future antendees so that the system becomes more streamlined.",
