The film is planned to feature interviews with politicians, civilians and also terrorists from the Riparian Terkan Liberation Front. Not only is Madia inevitably siding with them by giving space for its discourse instead of condemning its terrorist acts, they are also berating Hetia for 'abandoning' Terkan, thus establishing a parallel between Hetia and the Lamar region.\n    This documentary should be understood as another product of Madia's subtle anti-Lamar apparatus, in hopes of halting the annexionist process.",

Despite having a prosperous economy and declaring itself a socialist country, Madia has never officially positioned itself in any foreign conflict. Instead, it has maintained a performative activism soft enough to not interfere with its unobtrusive diplomatic relationships.\n    Madia's affinity to Hetia's progressive politics is widely known, just as its deliberate disregard of Hetia's severe migration policies -which especially affect Terkani migrants-.\n    Besides, an economic interest lies behind the production of the documentary, as it will be ready to be shown in Madia's own International Film Festival.",
