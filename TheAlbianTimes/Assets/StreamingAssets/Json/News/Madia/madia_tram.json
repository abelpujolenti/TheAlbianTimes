One of the campaign promises they made was the installation of more public transportation, especially for students and those entering the workforce. To this end, they have released their plans of the type of transportation that are to be implemented within the next 3 years. Every major city, including Lamar, Doma, and Comur, must have a metro and tram line. The city of Lamar has already started work on the tram line near the university, which has led to some controversy as it has replaced two car lanes.",

This addition, being initially popular, has angered some, as this line will replace some of the car lanes leading to the university. Despite that, the students are overall happy with the change.\n    The city of Comur is very against the changes happening. The leading government, LRL, agrees that its people don’t need the investment into public transport, rather into safer roads that facilitate car travel.",

There has been a conscious effort to make the major cities less car friendly whilst cramming people into public transport. Lamar is reducing the amount of lanes in the university area, known for its congestion. This is only going to make the problem worse as the city should be doing the exact opposite and adding more lanes.",
