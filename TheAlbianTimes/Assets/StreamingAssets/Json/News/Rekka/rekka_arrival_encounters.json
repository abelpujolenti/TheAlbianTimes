The host state of the International Religious Encounters refused both to transfer the organization of the event to another country and to increase security for the event.\n    Although the plans of the RTLF are unknown, Hetian intelligence says that there are indications that an action will occur in the coming days, which could endanger the integrity of the participants. If so, it would be a serious blow to diplomacy with Rekka, which has only just opened up to foreign countries.",

Marcel Vergara, president of the entity, recalled the report published on the labor camps, which shows that they are an essential element of the island's socioeconomic model.\n    MÃ¡rcio Freitas, another of the NGO's key figures, has declared that it is 'inadmissible' that Terkani society 'remains passive in the face of the oppression of the Rekkan population', taking into account 'the domination to which they have been subjected by Hetia and the dictatorial state of Terkan itself'. Freitas has received harsh criticism from the Terkani authorities, given his Madian nationality and his lack of contact with the reality of the country.",
