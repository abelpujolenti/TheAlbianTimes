Despite the efforts of the event's medical team, nothing could be done to save 36-year-old Echo of The Ocean from death.\n    Madia has already expressed its condolences to the Rekkan people for the loss of such a valuable leader.",

The priestess interrupted her greeting to express her 'unbearable burden' caused by an 'inescapable feeling that belongs to the order of the human'. She then collapsed to the floor, possibly from the effects of a dose of strychnine.\n    Rekkan religious leaders, upon being ordained, are required to take a vow of chastity that they must maintain even after retiring. Thus, it is likely that 36-year-old Echo of the Ocean had a lover and, unable to give them up or live in sin, concluded that death was the only solution.",

Echo of the Ocean, 36, interrupted her greeting to deliver an alternative speech that, despite attempts by the organization to silence her, managed to get through to the audience.\n    The priestess corroborated the existence of labor camps, as well as an authoritarian theocratic regime that suppresses any attempt to revolt or escape from the island. Thus, it can be affirmed that the cause of her suicide was the 'unbearable burden' that the fact of having been an accomplice of crimes against humanity supposed to her. Whether this will have consequences for the Rekkan political order is yet to be seen.",
