The prevention of this disease has been a critical concern for Xaya since the great epidemic that killed over ten thousand citizens six decades ago.\n    Xaya has guaranteed that a vaccination campaign will be launched in the coming months, and also confirmed their exportation plans for the vaccine. Thanks to scientific progress, polio could be nothing more than a distant memory in only a few years.",

Several activists from International Action for Human Rights have gone missing in the past months as well.\n    The vaccine can be understood as a political maneuvre to project a tolerant and humane image, aimed to strengthen economic relationships with the international community. Xaya's exportation plans for the vaccine further evidences its interest.",
