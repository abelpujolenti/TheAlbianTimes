Many of which have led to a little more stability and economic growth. Xaya has provided technology and finance to the region, claiming it to be part of their responsibility.",

It seems like the gradual erosion of Zuaniaâ€™s state, being caused by the pressure of colonialism, is not going to slow down as Xaya further pushes for their power over Zuania.",
